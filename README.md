Regex - This is a script that uses Python's re module to extract information from a text file (in this case phone book-type of entries from CS_data.txt) and adds it to a pandas dataframe. 

Twitterbot - This is a bot that will reply to a users tweet with a random episode from the TV Show, "12 Monkeys". Users need to tag the bot account with the phrase "Initiate Splinter Sequence". This will trigger the code and reply within 60 seconds with a random episode.
